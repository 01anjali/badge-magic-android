Badge Magic is an Android app to control LED name badges. The goal is to provide options to portray names, graphics and simple animations on LED badges. For the data transfer from the smartphone to the LED badge we use Bluetooth. The project is based on the work of [Gautier MECHLING](https://github.com/Nilhcem).

An introductory blog post of the project [is here](http://nilhcem.com/iot/reverse-engineering-bluetooth-led-name-badge).

## Devices

There are a number of devices with Bluetooth on the market. As far as we can tell they are all from the same manufacturer. When you get a device ensure it comes with Bluetooth. There are devices that don't support Bluetooth. These are not supported currently.
